Hello,

 

We are very very close to launching a Zooniverse project to help us with spectral classification. The problem is that SNID is littered with SNe that are considered "peculiar" and that isn't helpful to a non-expert. I want to update these labels, but I need some help (particularly for SE SNe). Below is a list of labels that I propose changing, please chime in on the SNe for which you have expertise:

 

There are 3 classes that I want to change wholesale:

Ic-broad >> Ic-BL
Ic-SL >> SLSN-1
Ia-99a >> Ia-norm


There are also several "peculiar" SNe that we need to label (or remove), this is where I really need everyone's help.


2005ek - Ic-pec >> ???
2005bf - Ib-pec >> ???
2005la - Ib-pec >> ???
2000cx - Ia-pec >> Ia-norm or remove?
2004aw - Ic-pec >> ???
1987A - II-pec >> II-norm [only peculiar in photometry]
2006gz - Ia-pec >> Ia-SC [though some argue this isn't actually SC]
2005hk - Ia-pec >> Ia-02cx
snls03D3bb - Ia-pec >> Ia-SC
2008ae - Ia-pec >> Ia-02cx
00cx - Ia-pec >> Ia-norm or remove?
2008D - Ib-pec >> Ib-norm
2002cx - Ia-pec >> Ia-02cx
2007uy - Ib-pec >> ???
08es - II-pec >> IIL
87A - II-pec >> II-norm
03fg - Ia-pec >> Ia-SC
2005cc - Ia-pec >> Ia-02cx
2008A - Ia-pec >> Ia-02cx
2006tf - II-pec >> IIn
05bf - Ib-pec >> ???
2006gz - Ia-pec >> Ia-SC [though some argue this isn't actually SC]

I assume you mean to change to SLSN-I, with capital I and not 1 to be consistent with e.g., SN Ia, Ib, etc

 

Adam, I'm not sure you have to get rid of the -pec type. Could just explain that in the instructions as well?. Anyway, if you want to clean it up here are some comments for the specific cases:

 

2005ek - Ic-pec >> ??? CF: SN Ic-norm  (low mass Ic when LC is taken into account)
2005bf - Ib-pec >> ??? CF: not so sure here, this allegedly transitions from a Ic to a Ib. perhaps set it to SN Ib/c?, or remove
2005la - Ib-pec >> ??? CF: Ibn or maybe Ib-narrow to be consistent with the format
2000cx - Ia-pec >> Ia-norm or remove?
2004aw - Ic-pec >> ??? CF: SN Ic-norm
1987A - II-pec >> II-norm [only peculiar in photometry], CF: OK
2006gz - Ia-pec >> Ia-SC [though some argue this isn't actually SC]
2005hk - Ia-pec >> Ia-02cx
snls03D3bb - Ia-pec >> Ia-SC
2008ae - Ia-pec >> Ia-02cx
00cx - Ia-pec >> Ia-norm or remove?
2008D - Ib-pec >> Ib-norm
2002cx - Ia-pec >> Ia-02cx
2007uy - Ib-pec >> ??? CF: SN Ib-norm
08es - II-pec >> IIL, CF: should be just Type II right if you want to be consistent with putting 87A as SN II
87A - II-pec >> II-norm, CF: OK
03fg - Ia-pec >> Ia-SC
2005cc - Ia-pec >> Ia-02cx
2008A - Ia-pec >> Ia-02cx
2006tf - II-pec >> IIn
05bf - Ib-pec >> ??? CF: not so sure here, this allegedly transitions from a Ic to a Ib. perhaps set it to SN Ib/c?, or remove

Hi Adam,

 

I’m a bit unclear to what exactly the aim is of the relabelling. I see that being more descriptive than just -pec is good but equally Ia-02cx is not going to mean anything to the public.

 

I really don’t like Ia-SC as a descriptive term since it seems increasingly unlikely that these are the explosions of white dwarfs above the Mch limit. If it’s just a label then it’s fine.

 

SN 2003fg is another name for snls03D3bb

00cx - Ia-pec >> Ia-norm or remove? [KM: Can you include it as 00cx-like? They’re not quite normal]

 

Cheers,

Kate

Hi All,

 

Thanks Jesper for bringing this to my attention.

I mostly concur with what has been stated below, a few more comments in blue.

Adam, I'm not sure you have to get rid of the -pec type. Could just explain that in the instructions as well?. Anyway, if you want to clean it up here are some comments for the specific cases:

 

>>> I do think that the “pec” tag is used way too much, and is not useful in a classification

>>> setting since it is not specified what is peculiar and how. If we are working on a

>>> spectroscopic classification project, then objects that are spectroscopically regular

>>> should not be tagged as peculiar.

2005bf - Ib-pec >> ??? CF: not so sure here, this allegedly transitions from a Ic to a Ib. perhaps set it to SN Ib/c?, or remove

 

>>> SN 2005bf is a spectroscopically regular SN Ib at peak (see my review in the SN handbook,

>>> Fig. 10) with very obvious He lines. Keep it as a SN Ib. It has a peculiar light curve, but this is

>>> not relevant.


2005la - Ib-pec >> ??? CF: Ibn or maybe Ib-narrow to be consistent with the format

 

>>> It is a transitional Ibn that shows also H. You can keep as Ibn if you want to keep it simple, 

>>> and save another tag (Ibn-transitional)


2000cx - Ia-pec >> Ia-norm or remove?

 

>>> This event is peculiar mostly in the photometric sense and less so in spectra, so I don’t think 

>>> you need it at all.


2004aw - Ic-pec >> ??? CF: SN Ic-norm

 

>>> This event is “in between” SNe Ic and Ic-BL. I would remove it since its early spectra are

>>> similar to Ic-BL, so if you keep it as Ic, you will have a leak of Ic-BLs into the regular ones.
